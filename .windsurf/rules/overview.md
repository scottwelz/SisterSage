At its core, this is an inventory management application specifically for a business, "Sister Sage Herbs," that sells products across two different platforms:

Shopify (for your online store)
Square (likely for in-person sales, like at a market)
The main goal is to solve the problem of keeping your inventory synchronized between these two separate sales channels. It gives you a single place to view and manage your stock levels.

Here are the key features:

Central Dashboard: After logging in, you see a dashboard with all your products.
Unified View: For each product, you can instantly see the current stock available on Shopify and the stock available on Square.
Manual Adjustments: You can easily update the stock counts for either platform right from the dashboard.
Secure Access: The Firebase authentication we set up ensures that only authorized users can view and manage the inventory.
Integration Ready: The settings page is the first step toward connecting directly to Shopify and Square APIs to automate inventory updates in the future.
In short, it's your command center for making sure your product availability is always accurate, whether a customer is buying online or in person.
