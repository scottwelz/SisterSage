# Migration Summary: Multi-Tenant to Single-Tenant

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Sister Sage Herbs inventory app from a multi-tenant SaaS architecture to a secure single-tenant system.

## üéØ Architecture Change

**Before:** Multi-tenant SaaS
- Each user had their own API credentials stored in Firestore
- Settings page for users to input their API keys

- Signup page for new users

**After:** Single-tenant application
- One business with one admin account
- API credentials stored in environment variables
- More secure (credentials never in database)
- Simpler deployment and maintenance

## üìù Files Modified

- Added Shopify configuration variables
- Added Square configuration variables
- Added webhook secret variables
- All sensitive credentials now in environment

**Created: `.env.example`**
- Template for environment variables
- Documents where to get each credential
- Safe to commit to version control

### API Routes

**Modified: `src/app/api/shopify/route.ts`**

## üîí Security Improvements

### Before
- ‚ùå API credentials stored in Firestore (encrypted but still in database)
- ‚ùå Credentials accessible via API endpoint
- ‚ùå Base64 encoding (not true encryption)
- ‚ùå Client-side credential handling
- ‚ùå Credentials could be accidentally exposed in database exports

### After
- ‚úÖ API credentials in environment variables only
- ‚úÖ Never stored in database
- ‚úÖ Server-side only access
- ‚úÖ Follows 12-factor app methodology
- ‚úÖ Easier to rotate credentials
- ‚úÖ No risk of database exposure

## üé® User Experience Changes

### Before
1. User signs up for new account
2. User logs in
3. User goes to Settings page
4. User enters API keys
5. Keys saved to database
6. App fetches keys when needed

### After
1. Admin creates account in Firebase Console
2. Admin configures API keys in `.env.local`
3. Admin logs in
4. App works immediately (no configuration needed)

**Result:** Simpler setup, more secure, easier to maintain

## üìä Database Schema Changes

### Removed Collections

- `userCredentials` - No longer needed
  - Previously stored encrypted API credentials per user
  - No migration needed (wasn't in production use)

### Unchanged Collections

- `products` - Still works exactly the same
  - No `userId` field needed (single tenant)
  - All authenticated users can access

## üöÄ Deployment Changes

All hosting platforms (Firebase, Vercel, etc.) need these set:

```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID
